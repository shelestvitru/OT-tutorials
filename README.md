# OT-tutorials
Hands-on Tutorials on computational Optimal Transport

# Session 1: Getting Started with Optimal Transport

-- Intro to Optimal Transport and the POT library\
-- Visualizing OT plans with `ot.emd` and `ot.sinkhorn`, seeing the influence of regularization\
-- Computing Wasserstein distances and easy barycenters

# Session 2: Implementing Sinkhorn and Beyond

-- Implementing the Sinkhorn algorithm from scratch via Duality perspective\
-- Exploring alternative regularizations (e.g., quadratic, sigmoid)\
-- Hands-on optimization with gradient-based solvers

# Session 3: Learning-Based OT Solvers

-- Overview of ML-driven OT solvers\
-- Meta Optimal Transport (Meta-OT) with TensorFlow\
-- Comparison with classical methods (e.g. computed with Sinkhorn)


# Session 4: Sampling and Dynamical OT

-- Examples of usage of OT in ML (Generating data with Sinkhorn loss)\
-- Dynamics and other sampling methods
